Science blog
===================

Still cant seem to make mathjax compilethe latex on this page...

$$ \sum^n_{i = 1} x_i $$

Peer-review is an indespensible resource for creating a permentant record of science. In the $$21^\text{st}$$ century, months (and sometimes years) is too long to get ideas out into the sunshine. Therefore, I am going to give this a shot as a science blog. Transparency is also at teh heart of academic ethics, and all scientists should strive to make their ideas, methods and results as transparent as humanly possible. I'm yet unsure if this is the right platform, but I like the kramdown environment, especially that it supports TeX!).

Check out my [github page][github-page] for a small selection of software that I have made public.
